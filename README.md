# AutoRes
A chrome extension for analyzing your resume against job description


The project is stuck as the author is broke and cant afford OpenAI credits.

Before using the extension: 
1) Make OpenAI account
2) Create a new API key 
3) Paste that key on line 4 in contentScript.js


How to Use:
1) Go to job description page
2) Upload your resume on extension
3) Press submit
4) See suggestions from OpenAI about your resume and the job description
